They imagine all this cool stuff they're going to do. \"A static site so I don't have to pay for hosting!\" \"I'll make subdomains for my blog and for my portfolio and for stuff I'm working on.\" \"I'm going to update it so much.\"\r\n\r\nBut they didn't update it. Go on, look at their [commit history](https://github.com/CatsAkimbo/catsakimbo.github.io/). A barren wasteland! If this website were a library, you'd glance at the most recent commit date and immediately mash on the back button.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of sites like this out there. They don't reflect much about the people who made them, just that they had other priorities. Maybe a new video game came out that's pretty fun. Or maybe they're out spending time with their family. They likely put all of their creative effort into their job, and have little left over for side projects like this.\r\n\r\nIn any case, that's what this is.",
